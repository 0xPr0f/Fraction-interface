# Fraction Protocol
Fraction is a protocol that allow users to earn on a particular asset, the ability to wrap an asset (usually a stablecoin) to an ERC1155 and earn yield in form of superfluid streams of a custom token.
We also offer the ability to mint a soulbound nft that bound users to their assets and earn them more interests in the streams
